#+TITLE: Ubuntu Provisioner

A collection of Ansible scripts to provision an Ubuntu dev machine.

* Requirements

  1. python / pip[x]
  2. ansible


  #+begin_src shell
    pipx install ansible-core
  #+end_src

* Defining Inventory

  You need to define what hosts to run the playbooks against. Create a file called =inventory= and add sections for the local machine as well as any remote hosts you want to run playbooks against. For example, an inventory file that looks like:

  #+begin_example
    [local]
    localhost ansible_connection=local

    [remote]
    s76
  #+end_example

  Will allow you to install software against the local machine as well as the "remote" hosts. In this case, the =s76= host is the name of a host that's defined within the =~/.ssh/config= file, something like:

  #+begin_example
    Host s76
      HostName 192.168.68.73
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      User myUserName
  #+end_example

* Running the playbook

  #+begin_src shell
    ansible-playbook --ssh-common-args "-F $HOME/.ssh/config" -i inventory --ask-become-pass playbook.yml --limit remote
  #+end_src
